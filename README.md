# The Big Picture

Created By: Gustavo Higuera & Luke Johnsen

## Introduction
In this repository, we created a movie application in which you can search a movie of your choice, and receive information about the searched movie, and also received 10 related movies.

Some of the movie information provided is a brief summary of the movies plot, the main cast members, ratings from the most popular movie critic websites, and box office information.

## How to Use
To start the application, enter a movie of your choice in the text area below "Search Movie: ". Then click the search button, and your movie information will be displayed on the page. If you continue to scroll down the page, you will see 10 related movies to the one you searched as well.

Your searches will be saved below "Previous Searches: " toward the top of the page. The saved searches are interactive, and can be clicked on to repopulate the movie information that you had searched.
